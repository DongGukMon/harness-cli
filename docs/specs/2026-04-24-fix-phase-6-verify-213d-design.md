# Fix Phase 6 verify precondition: ignore pre-existing dirty files — Design Spec (Light)

## Complexity

Small — scoped to one guard in `runPhase6Preconditions` plus a content-hashed baseline snapshot captured once at session init. No new flow, no new phase, no multi-repo refactor.

## Context & Decisions

**Problem.** `src/artifact.ts::runPhase6Preconditions` enforces a blanket working‑tree‑clean invariant via `git status --porcelain`, filtering only the eval report path (Step 2 and Step 4). On mission branches with any pre-existing uncommitted content (issue #68) or after a P7→P5 reopen cycle that leaves unrelated dirty files behind (issue #67), this guard throws immediately — Phase 6 never reaches verification, `durationMs<60ms`.

**Intent of the original guard.** The check exists to protect Phase 6 from a Phase‑5 failure mode where the implementor leaves tracked work uncommitted (so the eval report reflects an unstable tree). The invariant we actually want is *"no Phase‑5-introduced changes are uncommitted"*, not *"the working tree is pristine relative to the empty set"*.

**Chosen baseline anchor — content-hashed fingerprints.** The task prompt suggests `state.implRetryBase` "or equivalent". `implRetryBase` is a commit, which only captures tracked-file diffs — it cannot distinguish *pre-existing untracked files* from *Phase‑5-introduced untracked files*. We therefore snapshot the dirty state of `trackedRepos[0].path` (docsRoot, the only repo the precondition inspects) **once at session init**, after `.gitignore` housekeeping, as a set of *fingerprints* — one per dirty path — and persist it in `state.dirtyBaseline: string[]`.

Each fingerprint is the tuple `"<XY>\0<path>\0<hash>"`, where:
- `XY` is the 2-char porcelain status code (e.g. ` M`, `??`, `A `, ` D`).
- `path` is the path from porcelain column 4 onward.
- `hash` is `git hash-object -- <path>` for files that exist on disk, or `""` for deletions / missing files.

Phase 6 preconditions recompute the fingerprint for every live porcelain line and only filter entries whose fingerprint is present in the baseline set. **This closes the P1 feedback gap from gate‑2 review**: further Phase‑5 edits to a pre-existing dirty path change the file's content hash, so the live fingerprint no longer matches the baseline and the guard fires as intended.

**Why session-init rather than Phase‑5-open re-snapshot.** A baseline frozen at session init represents "state before the harness touched anything". Re-snapshotting at every Phase‑5 reopen would fold prior Phase‑5 leftovers into the baseline and mask real regressions. Session-init captures the user's genuine pre-existing dirt exactly once; everything introduced after that point is treated as Phase‑5 work and must be committed before Phase 6.

**Rollout scope — new sessions only (P2 feedback).** Legacy `state.json` files written before this change do not contain `dirtyBaseline`. The `loadState` migration defaults the field to `[]`, which preserves the *strict* pre-fix behavior for those in-flight runs. We explicitly decline to lazy-capture a baseline for legacy states on first load, because by the time a legacy run reaches this code path, Phase 5 may have already introduced uncommitted work that would be incorrectly baked into the baseline and masked. Users stuck on an in-flight run hit by #67/#68 are expected to start a new session (`harness run`) with the fixed build. This narrowing is intentional, documented, and matches the review suggestion.

**Scope boundaries.**
- Only `state.trackedRepos[0]` (docsRoot) gets a baseline — this matches the current single-repo behavior of `runPhase6Preconditions`. Multi-repo baseline is out of scope.
- No content-matching for renames (porcelain `R` status) — renames are extremely unlikely in pre-existing session-start state; treated as opaque line-string for baseline parsing. If encountered, the safer `hash = ""` falls through and the fingerprint still works.
- No change to the eval-report cleanup steps (Step 3 of preconditions).
- No change to the staged-file guard (Step 1 of preconditions — see D5).

**Ambiguity resolution.** No open questions remain after reviewing the two issues, the precondition implementation, the Phase‑5 reopen semantics (`src/phases/interactive.ts` Phase‑5 block), and the gate-2 review feedback. All decisions are fixed — no developer Q&A needed for this session.

## Requirements / Scope

R1. `runPhase6Preconditions` MUST filter out porcelain lines whose **fingerprint** (`<XY>\0<path>\0<hash>`) matches an entry in `dirtyBaseline`, in addition to filtering the eval report. Filtering is fingerprint-exact — a path whose content hash has changed since baseline capture MUST NOT match and MUST fire the guard.
R2. The fingerprint filter MUST apply to both the initial dirty check (Step 2) and the final clean check (Step 4).
R3. `state.dirtyBaseline: string[]` MUST be captured once at session init in `src/commands/start.ts`, after `.gitignore` commits and before `createInitialState` is persisted, from the porcelain output of `trackedRepos[0].path`. Each dirty path contributes one fingerprint string. Non-git roots and git roots with clean trees produce `[]`.
R4. `state.dirtyBaseline` MUST default to `[]` when reading legacy state files (backward-compatible migration in `src/state.ts::loadState`). Legacy in-flight runs retain strict pre-fix behavior by design (see Decision D4).
R5. Existing tests (`tests/artifact.test.ts`, `tests/phases/verify.test.ts`) MUST keep passing — baseline defaults to `[]` when omitted, matching the current strict behavior.
R6. New tests MUST cover:
    - Pre-existing tracked-dirty file whose fingerprint is in baseline → no throw (issue #68 repro, tracked variant).
    - Pre-existing untracked file whose fingerprint is in baseline → no throw (issue #68 repro, untracked variant).
    - Pre-existing dirty file + an additional **Phase-5-introduced** dirty file → still throws (regression guard).
    - **Pre-existing dirty file whose content is further modified after baseline capture** → still throws (fingerprint mismatch, closes P1 feedback gap).
    - Final clean check also respects baseline (baseline entries remain present after cleanup).
R7. No change to the error message (`'Working tree must be clean before verification'`) — keeps existing string assertions in tests and logs.

## Design

### State schema change

`src/types.ts`:

```ts
export interface HarnessState {
  // ... existing fields ...
  dirtyBaseline: string[]; // fingerprint strings captured at session init
}
```

`src/state.ts::createInitialState` returns `dirtyBaseline: []`. `loadState` migration:

```ts
if (!Array.isArray(raw.dirtyBaseline)) raw.dirtyBaseline = [];
```

### Fingerprint helper

A small helper — new exported function `captureDirtyBaseline(cwd: string): string[]` — lives in `src/artifact.ts` (next to `runPhase6Preconditions`, which is the only consumer). It runs `git status --porcelain`, parses each line into `{ xy, path }`, computes `git hash-object -- <path>` when the path exists on disk (safe-wrapped — missing file / `R` status fall through to `hash = ""`), and returns the fingerprint list `"<xy>\0<path>\0<hash>"`. Non-git cwd returns `[]`.

### Capture point in `src/commands/start.ts`

After step 11 (HEAD re-read post-`.gitignore` commit) and immediately after `state.trackedRepos = trackedRepos;` in step 12, call:

```ts
state.dirtyBaseline = inGitRepo ? captureDirtyBaseline(trackedRepos[0].path) : [];
```

### Precondition filter in `src/artifact.ts::runPhase6Preconditions`

Extend signature:

```ts
export function runPhase6Preconditions(
  evalReportPath: string,
  runId: string,
  cwd?: string,
  dirtyBaseline: string[] = [],
): void
```

Convert `dirtyBaseline` to a `Set<string>` once. In Step 2 (`porcelainOutput`) and Step 4 (`finalStatus`), **before** the existing eval-report filter, for each live porcelain line recompute the fingerprint (same parsing + `git hash-object`) and drop the line if its fingerprint is in the baseline set. Remaining logic unchanged.

Caller in `src/phases/verify.ts::runVerifyPhase` passes `state.dirtyBaseline ?? []`.

### Non-goals

- No per-repo baseline (trackedRepos[1+]).
- No re-snapshot on reopen.
- No lazy baseline capture for legacy in-flight runs (see D4).
- No change to `hasStagedChanges` / `isWorkingTreeClean` used in `start.ts` preflight.
- No change to the staged-file check in Step 1 of preconditions (still fires on any staged file other than the eval report — staged work is unambiguously Phase‑5 output the user forgot to commit, not "pre-existing dirt").

## Implementation Plan

- **Task 1 — State schema + migration.** Add `dirtyBaseline: string[]` to `HarnessState` in `src/types.ts`. Default it to `[]` in `createInitialState` (`src/state.ts`). Add the one-line migration in `loadState` (`src/state.ts`).
- **Task 2 — Fingerprint helper + session-init capture.** Add `captureDirtyBaseline(cwd)` in `src/artifact.ts`. In `src/commands/start.ts`, immediately after `state.trackedRepos = trackedRepos;` (step 12), assign `state.dirtyBaseline = inGitRepo ? captureDirtyBaseline(trackedRepos[0].path) : []`.
- **Task 3 — Filter precondition + wire caller + tests.** Extend `runPhase6Preconditions` with a `dirtyBaseline: string[] = []` parameter, compute live fingerprints and filter Steps 2 and 4 before the eval-report filter. Update `src/phases/verify.ts` to pass `state.dirtyBaseline ?? []`. Add five `tests/artifact.test.ts` cases covering R6 (including the content-mismatch regression for P1 feedback). Update `tests/phases/verify.test.ts` only if its `runPhase6Preconditions` mock assertion needs adjusting for the optional 4th arg.

## Eval Checklist Summary

Verification JSON lives at `.harness/2026-04-24-fix-phase-6-verify-213d/checklist.json`. It runs:

1. `pnpm tsc --noEmit` — typecheck the state schema + new signature.
2. `pnpm vitest run tests/artifact.test.ts` — unit coverage for `runPhase6Preconditions` including new baseline + content-mismatch cases.
3. `pnpm vitest run tests/phases/verify.test.ts` — ensure `runVerifyPhase` caller still integrates cleanly.
4. `pnpm vitest run` — full suite regression.
5. `pnpm build` — ensure dist compiles (integration tests reference dist).
